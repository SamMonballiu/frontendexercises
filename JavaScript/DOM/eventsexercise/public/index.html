      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

            <h1>Netscape Navigator</h1>
            <p>Netscape Navigator was a proprietary web browser, and the original browser of the Netscape line, from
              versions 1 to 4.08, and 9.x. It was the flagship product of the Netscape Communications Corp and was the
              dominant web browser in terms of usage share in the 1990s, but by 2002 its use had almost disappeared.
              This was primarily due to the increased use of Microsoft's <em>Internet Explorer</em> web browser software, and
              partly because the Netscape Corporation (later purchased by AOL) did not sustain Netscape Navigator's
              technical innovation after the late 1990s.</p>
